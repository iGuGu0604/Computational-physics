# Computational-physics
How time flies!

It's a record of what we learned in the Computational physics class taught by Hao Cai at WHU.

it's funny that I'm translating this homework to English to make others understand what I was doing, I miss my undergrad university so much...

The language we used is called Racket, it belongs to the Lisp family. Although it's barely used in computational physics, I guess our teacher used it for equity, because Racket was new for everyone.

Assignment 2:let the boat floating
Assignment 6: simple pendulum and chaotic system
Assignment final: molecular dynamics and FPUT model
